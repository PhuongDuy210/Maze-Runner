This is a 3D casual game for mobile and PC. In this game, you'll be solving auto-generated mazes in different game modes, including:
- Classic Mode: draw a path from start tile to the finish tile to solve unlimited number of mazes with increasing difficulty.
- Time Attack Mode: rotate the maze and use ball physics to guide your ball to the finish tile under a time limit.
- Versus Mode: guide your ball to the finish tile while racing against a computer AI. Whoever score 5 points first, win the game.

This repo includes an apk file for installing on Android but does not include a PC build. You'll have to use the project to build one yourself.
