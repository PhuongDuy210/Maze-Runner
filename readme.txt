This is a 3D casual game for mobile and PC. In this game, you'll be solving auto-generated mazes in different game modes, including:
- Classic Mode: draw a path from start tile to the finish tile to solve unlimited number of mazes with increasing difficulty.
- Time Attack Mode: rotate the maze and use ball physics to guide your ball to the finish tile under a time limit.
- Versus Mode: guide your ball to the finish tile while racing against a computer AI. Whoever score 5 points first, win the game.

How to play:
- Classic Mode: use your mouse (PC) or touch screen (Mobile) to draw a path and guild your ball to the finish tile.
- Time Attack Mode: move your mouse (PC) or your finger around the touch screen (Mobile) to rotate the maze. Let gravity and ball physics moves your ball.
- Versus Mode: touch/click the tile you want your ball (Red) to move to. If it requires less than 7 moves to make to the selected tile, the ball will move automatically, if not the ball will not move.

This repo includes an apk file for installing on Android but does not include a PC build. You'll have to use the project to build one yourself.
